# KitchenTracker

### Problem Statement

Whenever we visit grocery markets there are times when we forget a lot of important stuff to buy and we realize that our food inventory is empty. So we need some automated system to keep a track of the food items in our inventory and send notification on our mobile devices whenever there is a shortage of a food item. To solve this problem we came up with the idea of Kitchen Tracker.

### Overview

 - Relies on sensing the weight of a storage container to track food consumption

 - Helps to replenish the inventory just in time

 - Analytics â€“ Access historical inventory usage data for better prediction and planning.
